# Logistics-Data-Analysis-System
A Python-based dashboard to analyze shipping container delays and port congestion.
# Logistics & Shipping Container Data Analysis System

## 🚢 Overview
This project is a Data Analysis System designed to identify bottlenecks in global shipping logistics. It analyzes container movement data to find delay patterns across different carriers and ports.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automated Data Cleaning:** Handles missing timestamps and port names.
- **Delay Metrics:** Calculates 'Delay Days' to measure supply chain efficiency.
- **High-Risk Alerts:** Automatically flags shipments delayed by >10 days.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Built with Streamlit and Plotly for real-time filtering.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Plotly, Streamlit
- **Environment:** VS Code

## 📊 Sample Insights
- Identified **Mundra Port** as a major congestion point.
- Highlighted **Maersk** as having the highest average delay in the current dataset.
